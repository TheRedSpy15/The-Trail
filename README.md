This is my first Java project made in JavaFX to serve as a learning experience.
The Trail is basically a sci-fi-ish themed version of Oregon Trail, and written in Java instead.

Offical release is 2.0 and up for download on 1/1/2017 (mm/dd/yy)

# Contributing

Just make a commit, and that's it!

I make updates first to the "Pre-Update" branch and then to the Main branch when I feel the update is ready to go on the stable branch (Main)

# NOTE

The .jar file REQUIRES Java to be installed. A .exe will come for Windows users without Java.
