# The-Trail
The remake of Oregon Trail in JavaFX

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/99a9da07e094482d921f1930eaca3a5f)](https://www.codacy.com/app/hjadar15/The-Trail?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=TheRedSpy15/The-Trail&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)


This is my first Java project made in JavaFX to serve as a learning experience.
The Trail is basically a sci-fi-ish themed version of Oregon Trail, and written in Java instead.

# Road map

    WORKING ON

    * Settings menu in mid game menu
    * stop background music in shootout and play shootout music

      and print to it in a for-each loop
    * Abstraction
    * Removing "GOD" class


    NEEDED FEATURES (Coming)

    * Different cars have different max storage ( eg: green car - 6000 storage [ storage = water + food ] )
    * Body armour
    * System time in mid game menu
    * More cities
    * Personal armoury (gun inventory for selecting different guns with different traits)
    * More guns
    * chance to miss shooting at thief


    BIG FEATURES (updates)

    * Bank heists
    * Final battle against monkeys (END GAME)


    NICE TO HAVES (not likely to be added)

    * Support for resizing stage

# Contributing

Just make a commit, and that's it!

# NOTE

I make updates first to the "Pre-Update" branch and then to the Main branch when I feel the update is ready to go on the stable branch (Main)

Also, the .jar file REQUIRES to Java installed. A .exe will come for Windows users without Java.
