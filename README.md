# The-Trail
My first real project with JavaFX. This is more of a learning experience for me.

The project is a JavaFX version of the classic game knownas "Oregon Trail"

The code is kinda messy because it started out as a terminal game, to a super simple Javafx program without FXML files,
to having FXML files, Controllers, and the use of Scene Builder (SO USEFUL)
